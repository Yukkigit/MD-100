Module 2
		- Authorization  - Setting permissions / allowing access to specific resources, files & folders, hours of access, amount of allocated space / other specifications
		- Authentication - The process that confirms a users identity when attempting to access a resource.

	Windows authentication methods
		- Kerberos version 5 protocol - client-server based (windows specifically), used to authenticate users and groups 
		- NTLM (failover if kerberos is not able to perform authentication) - Includes three way handshake and makes use of password hashes (vulnerabilities - Pass-the-hash & brute-force attatcks
		- Cetrificate mapping	

	User profiles
		- Each user contains their own data file NTUser.dat - maps to HKEY_CURRENT_USER	

	Acitve Directory is group of services repsonsible for identety-related management. it is uses a structured data store as the basis for logical, hierarchical orginization and directory information = referred to as objects. 

	AD Services (AD DS) are repsonsible for storing directory data and making it availible to the .
	network 

	Azure AD  is a cloud based identity and access mangement service, responsible for prividing accessibility to resoucres for the network and administrators.
	Azure AD is able to sync with AD DS via the Azure AD Connect tool allowing on-premises & cloud to connect.
		Azure AD conncet tool provides the following functionalities
			- Password has syncronization - allows hashes of passwors to be synched to the cloud
			- Pass-through authentication - Allows users to use the same password as on-prem
			- Federation intergration	  - 
			- Syncronization			  - Responsible for synchronizing resources / information
			- Health monitoring

	Sign into domain
		- AD DS
			- If the DNS servers are not ser properly the following failures might occur
				- Authentication failures
				- Slow sign ins
				- Windows uses cached credentials
			When permissions are applied you must perform the following
				- reauthenticating user account - re-sign into the profile
				- reauthenticating a computer 	- restart the system

	Microsoft Device stratergy framework
		High trust, low trust, high freedom, low freedom
			(summarized as followis)
			- On your own			
			- Bring your own device		- Managed device / unmanaged device
			- Choose your own device (CYOD)
			- Here is your own device 

	Device registration
		Purpose
			- Registratioin in AD DS for non-domain joined devices
			- SSO for selected applications and resources in a company's internal network

			Device registration signs devices with a CA which is used to authenticate the device when accessing resources.

Module 3
	Windows activation types
		- OEM
		- Retail
		- Microsoft volume licensing/ volume activation
			AD Activation, KMS, multiple activation methods (MAK)


				- Active directory-based activation (ADBA)
					- Enables activation for devices that are connected to the domain
					- The device requires a generic volume license key (GVLK)
				- MAK activation
					- For devices that infrequently connect to the corporate server - 
						- MAK independant activation - each device connects to the internet / telephone to activate
						- MAK proxy activation		 - connects to a proxy server to activate
				- KMS activation 
					- Devices connect to the KMS server every 2 hours to attempt activation - KMS Server activates via connection to the internet
					- The device confirms activation every 180 days
					- Workgroup connections are availible
					- RCP protocol over TCP/IP 1688 

	script to confirm activtion status - cscript C:\windows\system32\slmgr.vbs -dli

	Group policy
		- GPO applies in the following order
			- Local GPO
			- Site GPO
			- Domain GPO
			- OU GPO
			- Child OU policies

		- options for modifying GPO processing
			- Security filtering - Making use of security permissions to specify who is able/or not to access the GPO
			- Enfocement		 - enforcing a GPO
			- Block Inharitance	 - prevngint lower OU from inharinting the GPO policy from higher OU

	Windows poweshell
		- uses drives to access set data on the system
			- The C drive
			- The cert drive
			- The Env drive
			- Th HKCU drive
			- The HKLM drive
			- Variable drive - variables stored in the system memory

		- CMDLETS
			- Cmdlets are based on paramaters such as "Get-NetIPAddress, Start-Service"
				- Get-help represents a helper and provides additional information of the specified parameters
				- Get-Command provides a list of installed/availible commands

		Windows start menu
		Windows 10
			- Exporting the start menu to XML
				Export-StartLayout -UseDesktopApplicationID -Path \\FileServer01\StartLayouts\StartLayoutMarketing.xml

			- Full layouts 
				: Lockes the start menu layout
			- Partial layouts
				Modify the <DefaultLayoutOverride> element to include the following property:
					<DefaultLayoutOverride LayoutCustomizationRestrictionType="OnlySpecifiedGroups">
		Windows 11
			- Export-StartLayout -Path "C:\Layouts\LayoutModification.json"

		Configuring Windows Taskbar
			- Universal Windows Platform apps use the element <taskbar:UWA>and include the Application User Model ID (AUMID).
			- Desktop applications use the element <taskbar:DesktopApp> and include the Desktop Application Link Path.

				- UWP elements - <taskbar:UWA> 
				- Desktop apps elements - <taskbar:DesktopApp>
				- Use command "Get-StartApps" to find the identifiers

	Drivers
		- Consists of 3 files
			-.inf file - provides information about the driver file
			- any file that the .inf file references
			- catalog (.cat) file - contains a signed certificate of the device driver
		- stored in %Systemroot%\System32\driverstore	

	Printers
		Note some printers require the drive to be installed before adding the printer - best practice
		Printmanagement.msc - used to manage installed printers & remote device printers 
		printutil.exe - cmd command
		Devices and Printers - used to manage locally

		- Deployment methods
			- Add a locally attached printing device automatically
			- Manually browse for a shared network printer
			- Find a printer in the directory
			- Deploy printers by using Group Policy settings
			- Deploy printers by using Group Policy preferences
		Type 3 vs Type 4
			- A Type 4 printer driver model provides the following benefits:
			- Sharing a printer doesn't require adding extra drivers that match the client architecture.
			- A single Type 4 driver can support multiple printer models.
			- Driver files are isolated on a per-driver basis, which prevents potential driver file-naming conflicts.
			- Driver packages are smaller and more streamlined than Type 3 drivers, and Type 4 drivers install faster than Type 3 drivers.
			- Printer driver and the printer user interface can be deployed independently with Type 4 drivers.
